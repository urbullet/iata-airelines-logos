# iata-airelines-logos
PNG images for most known airlines (1119 image), all named based on their IATA code


## How to use

### Note: If you only want the images without running the script yourself, then go to `scripts/airlines-logos`, I have already uplaoded them after running the script. Otherwise:


1. Create an empty folder called "airlines-logos" inside scripts directory
2. from the scripts directory, run on the terminal `python get-airlines-logos.py`
3. wait until every icon is downloaded, it will contain all the logos it found.
